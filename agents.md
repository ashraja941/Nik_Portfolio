The user wants to make the following changes to the gallery pop-up:

1.  **Make the pop-up take up most of the screen.**
2.  **Display images under one another for scrolling, instead of clicking to navigate.**
3.  **Close the pop-up on an outside click.**

I have already implemented the outside click to close and removed the previous/next buttons and keyboard shortcuts. I have also modified the dialog to display all images in a scrollable list and added the necessary CSS to make the pop-up larger and the images scrollable.

The user also asked how to control the column layout on the "My Work" page. I have explained that this is controlled by the `LAYOUT` object in `app/data/projects.js`.
